# Introduction.  

This notebook reports on the inference of microbial association networks from meta-taxonomic data extracted from [DairyFMBN](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3cwf729p34.3) using package [NetCoMi](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi), after some pre-processing carried out mostly with package [phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/).  

The objective of this analysis is:  

* infer microbial association networks (at the genus level) for selected cheese studies stored in DairyFMBN usign different inference methods  

* identify associations which are conserved across methods  

* compare different inference methods 

* identify and compare hubs in different networks
  
The data used in this script include studies from FMBN versions 3.2, with different platforms and target, but analyzed using the same pipeline based on DADA2. The script is designed to work with phyloseq objects extracted from FoodMicrobionet or DairyFMBN using the ShinyFMBN app DairyFMBN can be downloaded from [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3cwf729p34/3): new versions are due soon.  
The script will also work correctly with phyloseq objects generated using the DADA2 [BioConductor pipeline](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) but the use of SILVA as a taxonomic database is advisable.  With some adaptations the script may work with phyloseq objects generated using other pipelines.  

# Analysis workflow.  

1. **start from n (n>1) `phyloseq` objects**. In this analysis I will use phyloseq objects extracted from DairyFMBN (which, in turn, includes all studies on dairy products stored in FoodMicrobionet). Although pooling at the genus level is likely to muddle some interactions, it it the only reasonable choice when comparing studies with vastly different targets, sequencing platforms, bioinformatic pilelines, etc. 

2. **perform data-wrangling with phyloseq functions (mostly)**. There are a number of basic operations which should be performed:  

    + remove samples with a low number of sequences (`minseq`) using the prune_samples() functions (and perhaps skip the analysis if there is less than min_samples). Note that sample and taxonomic filtering can be also performed within the `NetCoMi::netConstruct()` function
  
    + remove _Eukaryota_ and _Chloroplasts_ using subset_taxa()
  
    + remove taxa with ambiguous identification or poor identification (say at the domain or phylum level)
  
    + perform prevalence and abundance filtering (prevalence above min_prev AND abundance above min_rel_ab), possibly using `filter_taxa()`
  
    + return some sort of summary for what has been done and the effect on the original table (in terms of loss of taxa, sequences, samples), including some measure of diversity and evenness  
  
3. **perform microbial association network inference with `netConstruct()`** with some error trapping and store results in a list. This example uses the following inference methods:  

    + **SparCC** (sparcc() in SpiecEasi package): needs high number of taxa and sparse matrix  
    
    + **CCREPE** (ccrepe package, it is the main approach used in CoNet)  
    
    + **SpiecEasi** (SpiecEasi package)  
    
    + **SPRING** (SPRING package)  

4. **get nodes, edges and network stats**: use NetCoMi::netAnalyze() to get an object with both node and network stats; print a summary for network stats; build a tidygraph object for further stats; build tidy data frames with relevant stats; 

The script is esigned to save data and amny of the plots in a subfolder (here "netcompare_output").

## Loading the objects to process.  

The input data are stored in a folder (input_data) and processed one by one (depending on user input) or in batch (see process_batch option). The folder should also contain a .tsv with study metadata, with a label variable with the number of the study and an indicator on the nature of the file (FMBN or, if the accn number is in the name, ASV). Here I am loading 5 studies from DairyFMBN (ST106, ST110, ST115, ST131, ST136). The studies differ in the targets (ST106 targets V1-V3 RNA, the others the 16S RNA gene, V4 or V3-V4) and platform. Look at the example files to see how the study_metadata file should be setup.   

```{r load_input_data, echo = FALSE}

if(keep_time) tic("loading phyloseq objects")
# obtain the list of files in the input folder
input_file_list <- list.files(file.path(data_folder))
# manage .rdata files first (but they must be phyloseq objects or will be deleted later)
rdata_input_file_list <- input_file_list[str_detect(input_file_list, ".rdata|.Rdata|.RDATA")] 
# get the list .Rdata
rdata_names_list <- str_remove(rdata_input_file_list, ".rdata|.Rdata|.RDATA")
rdata_path_list <- file.path(data_folder,rdata_input_file_list)
# load and save as .rds, remove objects and files
for (i in seq_along(rdata_path_list)){
  load(rdata_path_list[i]) # loads the object as physeqdata
  saveRDS(physeqdata, file.path(data_folder, paste(rdata_names_list[i],".rds",sep="")))
  rm(physeqdata)
  file.remove(rdata_path_list[i])
}

# get the names for the .rds files

input_file_list <- list.files(file.path(data_folder))
rds_input_file_list <- input_file_list[str_detect(input_file_list, ".rds|.RDS")] 
names_list <- str_remove(rds_input_file_list, ".rds|.RDS")
rds_path_list <- file.path(data_folder,rds_input_file_list)
# load all the files in a list using a functional
physeq_list <- lapply(rds_path_list, readRDS)
# check if all are phyloseq objects
is_phyloseq <- sapply(physeq_list, function(x) class(x)=="phyloseq")
# clean up the list if necessary and give names
physeq_list <- physeq_list[is_phyloseq]
names(physeq_list) <- names_list[is_phyloseq]
# if process_batch == F need to indicate which is to be processed; defaults to the first element of the list
# so, it is easier if you just have one element in the folder
item_to_process <- item <- NA_integer_
if(!process_batch) {item <- ifelse(is.na(item_to_process), 1, item_to_process)}
if(!is.na(item)){
  physeq_list <- physeq_list[item]
  }


# should check if this is too large
# size_limit 
size_limit <- 500e6L
physeq_size <- obj_size(physeq_list)
size_warning <- ifelse(as.numeric(physeq_size)>size_limit,
                       "WARNING: too much data to process",
                       paste("object size", as.character(physeq_size), " B", sep = " ")) 
# load the study metadata (if not available or not properly formatted the script will create a suitable data frame)
# no input required, should work with defaults
study_metadata <- load_metadata()
# print the study metadata
study_metadata %>% 
  dplyr::select(label:studyId, samples, short_descr, type, ref_short)

if(keep_time) toc()

```

## Filtering.  

Filtering optionally filters samples and taxa (on the basis of taxonomy and of a prevalence and abundance filter) and returns the filtered `phyloseq` objects in a separate list. Taxonomic agglomeration is optionally carried out. The options for filtering are those defined in the options section.  

### Filter samples.  

Samples with less than a given number of sequences are discarded first. As a consequence, a given `phyloseq` object may fall out below the set minimum of samples. Therefore the number of samples per object is checked again.

```{r filter_and_glom_samples, dpi = 96}
if(keep_time) tic("filter and glom samples")
# first prune objects with less than min_seqs sequences
physeq_list_0  <- physeq_list
# create first step of the filtering report
filtering_report <- vector("list", length = length(physeq_list))
filtering_report_0 <- map(physeq_list, report_step_0)
for(i in seq_along(physeq_list)){
  cat("processing ", i, " of ", length(physeq_list), "\n")
  # set plot_ecdf=F for faster execution
  physeq_list_0[[i]] <- prune_samples_by_size(physeq_list[[i]],
                                              names(physeq_list)[i], 
                                              plot_ecdf = F, 
                                              minseqs = min_seqs)
}
cat("...done pruning samples...\n")
# now recheck if all objects have enough samples
physeq_list_1 <- rem_low_sample_obj(physeq_list_0, ms = min_samples)
# create second step of the filtering report
stage_name = "prune samples"
for(i in seq_along(physeq_list_0)){
  if(names(physeq_list_0)[i] %in% names(physeq_list_1)){
    name <- names(physeq_list_0)[i]
    stage <- report_step_n(my_physeq = physeq_list_1[[name]], 
                           my_physeq_o = physeq_list_0[[i]], 
                           stage_name = stage_name) 
  } else {
    stage <- c(stage_name,
              samples = NA_real_,
              sequences = NA_real_,
              taxa = NA_real_,
              prop_samples = NA_real_,
              prop_seq = NA_real_,
              prop_taxa = NA_real_)
  }
  filtering_report[[i]] <- rbind(stage_0 = as.character(filtering_report_0[[i]]), stage_1 =stage)
  names(filtering_report)[i] <- names(physeq_list_0)[i]
}


if(verbose_output) print(filtering_report)
if(play_audio) beep(sound = 6)
if(keep_time) toc()
```

## Taxonomic filtering.  

A number of taxonomic filtering operations is performed at this stage (depending on the nature of the object and filtering options, set in the setting_options chunk). Plots are optionally produced and saved.  

```{r taxonomic_filtering, dpi = 96}
if(keep_time) tic("taxonomic filtering, step 1")

# check the nature of the taxonomic table
# in FMBN you either have ASV tables or tax tables with agglomeration at the species level or above
# which are the names of the tax levels?
tax_levels <- c("domain","phylum","class","order","family","genus","species")
# get/set rank names (this is necessary because phyloseq objects from FMBN or from the
# bioconductor pipeline with SILVA have different names)

physeq_list_2 <- lapply(physeq_list_1, gset_rank_names, tax_levels = tax_levels)
# remove uncharacterized taxa in all phyloseq objects (using a functional)
physeq_list_3 <- physeq_list_2

  physeq_list_3 <- lapply(physeq_list_3, subset_taxa, domain !="Eukaryota")
}

# optionally remove chloroplasts and mitochondria 
if(rm_chlmit) {
  physeq_list_3 <- lapply(physeq_list_3, remove_Chl_Mit)
}

# use lookup table to change taxonomy of Lactobacillus; necessary for phyloseq objects produced with SILVA
# but not for objects extracted from FMBN (which are transformed before extraction); will also change the 
# taxa names for ASVs
# MAY BE SLOW
if(use_lookup){
  # loop over the list of phyloseq objects
  for(i in seq_along(physeq_list_3)){
    # check the length of the names of the taxa; if <100 it is from FMBN, break
    if(mean(sapply(taxa_names(physeq_list_3[[i]]), nchar),na.rm = T)<100){
      next
    } else {

# Inferring the networks.

I will now try Microbial Association Network inference, with the methods and parameters specified in the options chunk. Separate lists will be generated for each method.  
An error trapping routine has been implemented: if MAN estimation fails a try-error object rather than an object of class microNet will be returned.  
All the returned objects will be saved in a list (1 slot for each phyloseq object, each with 1 slot for each inference method).

## Edge properties.  

Edges and edge properties can also be extracted for further use. Important edge properties are:

* edge type (positive or negative)  

* edge weight and association measure

* edge betweenness  

It is also convenient to compare edges among different graphs (and to do so it might be convenient to make sure that "to" and "from" are always in alphabetical order, which is always true within the same graph but might not be necessarily true among different graphs).  
The following chunk will (optionally): 

* integrate node (calculated with `netAnalyse()`) in the tidygraph list, 

* calculate edge betweenness,  

* compare networks (within dataset) by producing and saving Venn diagrams of the edges

Finally, a data frame with all edges will be produced for further use.

Looking at the Venns it can be seen that the sparsest networks are almost always produced by SPIEC-EASI and that the number of edges shared by all methods for any given is very low. 

# Comparing global properties.

Comparing global network properties may be of assistance in evaluating the effect of the inference method or of the type of study. Although NetCoMi offers very effective tools to compare two networks, it does not easily generalize to more than 2-3 networks. Here, I will use the global_all_df and global_lcc_df and produce graphs using PCA.

With these many datasets and inference methods the PCA becomes difficult to use. Note how the properties of the network are, as expected, specific to any given inference methods and data-set and how methods based on correlation (sparCC and CCREPE) tend to be closer among them than to methods based on conditional dependence. 

The analysis is repeated below on the largest connected component for each network.

The results are similar, and there is not much to add. While SPIEC-EASI produces the most sparse networks (and can be a candidate for the detection of the most parsimonious interaction sets), CCREPE and SparCC both may detect indirect interactions and, detecting clusters in this networks may be useful to detect sub-biomes within a given study.

 
# Plotting selected networks.  

I will now use tidygraph and ggraph to plot the networks. The thickness of the edges is made proportional to the absolute value of the association measure. Copresence edges are in green, mutual exclusion ones in red. Size of the nodes is made proportional to the total degree (negative degree + positive degree). The color of the nodes is determined by the phylum. Some of this options can be adjusted in the call to the plot_ggraph() function below. Others must be adjusted in the code of the function (all functions are in the source folder).  

```{r plotting_networks, dpi = 96}
if(keep_time) tic("Plotting the networks with ggraph")
# create a list of network plots

Due to the large number of interactions it is hard to discuss the results. In some of the graphs clusters are clearly evident (and could be highlighted by using the cluster id for colors). The structure of the graphs obtained with the different methods for each given dataset is also different. This may be due to the fact that both the correlation based methods may detect indirect interactions.  
In addition, given the scope of this analysis (with emphasis on nodes and edges conserved across different studies) there is little point in discussing individual networks, because this would require going into detail in the experimental approach used in each study.  
The following chunk is designed to compare network plots built with different methods in a grid. Two of the datasets (chosen because they returned a network for all inference methods and because they had networks of different complexity have been chosen here). However, due to the large number of elements in the graph, plotting all the elements (graph, legend, title) is difficult and may require acting on graphic parameters.

# Node analysis.

When comparing networks from several studies it might be of interest to classify nodes on the basis of their measures of centrality across multiple studies: is there a super hub (i.e. a node which i a hub in several networks)? How are different centrality measures related? Are there nodes which engage more often in negative interactions? Of course it would be pointless to compare across several methods of inference or, given the results above, between ASV and FMBN studies (when aggregation at the genus level is used).
This script will produce a few node plots as a proof of concept. Both SPIEC-EASI and SparCC will be used on data extracted from FMBN and aggregated at the genus level.

The node plots provide a number of visual cues:

* the horizontal and vertical dotted lines show the average value for degree and positive degree and may help in identifying nodes whose values are far from the mean;  

* the diagonal continuous line corresponds to points for which positive degree and degree are equal; points above the line have at least 1 negative interaction

* the diagonal dotted line is the linear regression line for degree as a function of positive degree; its position and slope relative to the previous line indicates on average how much the ratio between total degree and positive degree changes as a function of degree; data points which are far from this line also have an unusual ratio between the two values compared to the other nodes in the same dataset.  

* negative hubs will be located close to the upper left corner; positive hubs will be closer to the right of the plot.  

Even with SPIEC-EASI the number of plotted nodes is high for some studies (but very low for others), and one may consider plotting a given number of nodes (the ones with top degree? top eigenvector centrality?, some combination of both) to simplify the plot.  
Said that, although betweenness centrality may be interesting to identify "bottleneck" taxa, looking at betweenness is difficult (the shades of alpha = transparency are visually difficult to separate), but otherwise degree, positive degree and abundance are all easy to visualise.  

# Edge analysis.  

Edge analysis only makes sense once one has settled for meaningful questions and selected a large and diverse enough set of studies.
Questions which might be relevant:

* how stable is an edge?

  + within a study across methods
  
  + across studies with a given method
  
* given an inference method, can one assemble a consensus network using as weights the number of times a given edge occurs? The frequency of occurrence?

* how important is an edge (as measured by edge betweenness)? One must choose a meaningful context for this

* are co-occurrence relationships more frequent among members of the same class or family (and the reverse for mutual exclusion)? This only makes sense within a given method and must be corrected by the frequency of ech given larger taxon.

* given a (possibly important) microorganism, with which microorganisms is it most frequently associated with positive or negative associations? This only makes sense within a given method and once one has analyzed a large number of studies

* for moderately large networks, which is the cumulative distribution of edge betweenness? Does this hold any importance in terms of structure of the networks?

            iqr_ebq = IQR(ebq)) %>%

  ungroup()

  dplyr::filter(str_detect(dataset, "FMBN")) %>%

# let's try a plot (gives an emphasis to most stable edges)

    mutate(edge_name = forcats::fct_reorder(edge_name, med_ebq))

```
Many of the most stable edges include gut bacteria and probably represent cluster of interactions from this environment which are carried over to milk and then, possibly, cheese (some studies analyzed here include also environmental samples, like feces).  
The analysis here was carried out by groping by dataset and association type, therefore the frequency is by dataset and a frequency of 4 indicates that a given edge was detected by all 4 methods in a single dataset. The code can be easily modified to detect edges which are conserved across different studies and different methods.
I will now try to estimate the taxonomic assortativity. To do this, the odds ratio (OR) for copresence links (given that the nodes belong to the same family) and mutual exlusion links (given that the nodes belong to different families) is calculated and the significance is evaluated using `epi.2by2()` function.

Even if the odds ratios are very high in some cases (actually Inf, due to division by 0) they are not significant. My conclusion is that there is not sufficient support for the occurrence of taxonomic assortativity (i.e. for a significantly higher probability of having a copresence link between members of the same family).  
Similar results can be obtained when looking at the order and class level.
